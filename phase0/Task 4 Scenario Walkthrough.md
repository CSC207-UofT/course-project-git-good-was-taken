  A given clinic receives a batch of 420 Pfizer vaccine doses and this batch must be logged into the
clinic’s vaccine management system. Using the CommandLine, a clinic manager inputs their clinic
ID which cross references a list of valid clinic IDs. Once the Clinic is selected, the clinic manager
indicates that they want to add a VaccineBatch to the Clinic’s VaccineSupply, using the
BatchAdding class. They specify the batch ID (69), brand (Pfizer), the number of individual doses
(420), and the expiry date for this VaccineBatch (e.g. 2 months from today). This sets off a chain of
events that results in a new VaccineBatch being created for the given Clinic’s VaccineSupply.
